# **HHA507 || Module 3 || Python Assignment: Descriptive Analytics on SPARCS 2022 Data**
## _*Project Title: SPARCS Descriptive 2022*_

---

This repository contains my analysis and documentation for the 2022 SPARCS (Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System) dataset. It includes **loading a portion of de-identified data**, **performing basic descriptive statistics** and **creating visualizations**. This allows me to explore *healthcare trends*, *patient demographics*, and *hospital performance metrics*.üë©üèª‚Äçüíªüè•üìä

## _*Steps Taken to Perform the Analysis*_

### (1) The De-identified Data:

1. I downloaded the dataset from **`health.data.ny.gov`**
    - For further information and a link to the dataset: [Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS De-Identified): 2022](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/5dtw-tffi/about_data)

2. I used **pandas** to load a subset of data into a **`Python`** environment using my **`Visual Studio Code`**. I was able to explore data which includes `Age Group`, `Gender`, `Length of Stay`, `Total Charges`, `Total Costs`, and `Types of Admission`.


### (2) Exploring Categorical Variables:

- The distributions and trends within the following are explored:
    - Age Group
    - Gender
    - Type of Admission
    - Length of Stay
    - Total Charges
    - Total Costs
    - Type of Admission


### (3) The Basic Descriptive Statistics:

- To understand the typical patterns and variations in **Length of Stay**, **Total Charges**, and **Total Costs**, I calculated the following:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Standard Deviation
    - Min/Max
    - Percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)
    - Quartiles


### (4)Data Visualization:

- **Histogram** of _*Length of Stay*_: It visually represents the distribution of hospital stay durations.

- **Boxplot** for _*Total Charges*_: It helps identify potential outliers in the cost of care.

- **Bar plot** for _*Type of Admission*_: It provides insights into the relative frequencies of different reasons of admission.


### (5) Handling Missing Data:

 - Check for missing data/values.
 - Remove rows with missing values.
 - Fill missing data with the mean.
 - Verify if the filling the missing data is successful.

### (6) Summary  Report and My Key Takeaways:

- (a) Average Length of Stay:



- (b) Total Cost Variation:




- (c) Noticeable Trends:
